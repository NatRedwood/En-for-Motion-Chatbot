# En-for-Motion-Chatbot

PDF version of the paper includes all the details about the project: [paper](https://github.com/NatRedwood/En-for-Motion-Chatbot/blob/main/RedwoodN_En_for_Motion_Chatbot.pdf).

## What is En-for-Motion?
Welcome to the En-for-Motion chatbot, a mental health chatbot that uses language to assess an individual’s mental health. RST is a linguistic theory that aims to identify how text is structured to convey meaning. I hypothesize that the RST relations, when applied to chatbot conversations, can help assess an individual’s mental health status accurately.

## Why bother?
The primary aim is to investigate the potential of the En-for-Motion chatbot in assessing an individual’s mental health. In the paper, I discuss the methodology used in building the chatbot and evaluating its effectiveness in assessing mental health.

## How does it work?
