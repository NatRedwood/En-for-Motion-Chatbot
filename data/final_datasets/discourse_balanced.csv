Was this the one they had heard?,attribution
The wolf answered:,attribution
"Inferior, indeed! said the buckwheat.",attribution
"And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down.",attribution
"Ah, yes; sleep is a capital invention.",attribution
A kings son soon came.,attribution
"Oh, no one.",attribution
Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard.,attribution
A kings son soon came.,attribution
Ugh!,attribution
The wolf answered:,attribution
He is a king's son!,attribution
"Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.",attribution
Baa!,attribution
The cat replied:,attribution
Guard it well.,attribution
Humph!,attribution
"With the greatest pleasure, said the Princess.",attribution
I propose to you.,attribution
Humph!,attribution
"Fundevogel said: Neither now, nor ever.",attribution
PUGGIE DIED!!,attribution
And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared.,attribution
Certainly I have! said Jack.,attribution
"At daybreak, however, everything ceased.",attribution
Topoff!,attribution
Guard it well.,attribution
"I see it, she said.",attribution
Again it cried:,attribution
Perhaps he is ferrying still?,attribution
"This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood.",attribution
Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde.,attribution
"I was on board the Denmark, in Steene Bille's squadron; I had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear.",attribution
Hallo! shouted Jack the Dullard.,attribution
"Now I will free you, Mrs. Meta Mogen!",attribution
"Well, what can the seventh and last do?",attribution
DING-DONG! ding-dong!,attribution
"No, she replied, that is all we have.",attribution
"Eh! thought he, what a stupid blockhead I am!",attribution
And they passed on.,attribution
Begone!,attribution
"Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.",attribution
Half-done!,attribution
It is Christmas.,attribution
Were they not high-born?,attribution
I gave a horse for it.,attribution
How well they look!,attribution
"I will see to it, master, answered Gretel.",attribution
Delaying is not forgetting!,attribution
"Well, what can the seventh and last do?",attribution
No sooner had he entered than he noticed that the air was not pure.,attribution
Delaying is not forgetting!,attribution
"Oh, said Jack the Dullard, I can hardly tell you.",attribution
So the forenoon passed.,attribution
Grand cooperative Jumble!,attribution
The cat said:,attribution
PUGGIE DIED!!,attribution
HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VIST MR KORBES,attribution
PUGGIE DIED!!,attribution
What have you dreamt this time? asked he.,attribution
It is terribly warm here! he observed.,attribution
All this have we won by our labour.,attribution
"There are the three golden hairs for you, said she.",attribution

What are you saying?,attribution

Now listen!,attribution
Hallo! shouted Jack the Dullard.,attribution
"My house is out there in the dark forest, he said.",attribution
"He answered: Father, I have learnt what the birds say.",attribution
And they passed on.,attribution
Dim forms flitted by.,attribution
The maid replied:,attribution
And now Olaf Hase arrives.,attribution
"When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly.",attribution
PUGGIE DIED!!,attribution
"Just Heaven! cried she, my deliverance is at hand!",attribution
Do you know?,attribution
"In a peasant woman's humble room stood Frederick the Sixth, writing his name with chalk on the beam.",attribution
She is a poor girl.,attribution
"And as he returned no answer, it said,",attribution
"Then the King said, To-morrow we will hunt once more.",attribution
"With the greatest pleasure, said the Princess.",attribution
Perhaps he is ferrying still?,attribution
"Now I will free you, Mrs. Meta Mogen!",attribution
It is Christmas.,attribution
Too-whoo!,attribution
Where is thy husband?,attribution
"And Chanticleer replied,",attribution
It is Christmas.,attribution
God knows.,attribution
Shall we beat him? they said.,attribution
"Oh! cried the devil, what are you doing?",attribution
Was this the one they had heard?,attribution
Here's a cooking utensil with a tin handle.,attribution
Ah!,attribution
DING-DONG! ding-dong!,attribution
"The third lion reminded him of Margaret, who united Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.",attribution
"The wolf greeted her, and said:",attribution

How?,attribution
Baa!,attribution
Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde.,attribution
Too-whoo!,attribution
The cat replied:,attribution
"My house is out there in the dark forest, he said.",attribution
"As much as you like, answered he.",attribution
To thy death art thou sped Until Gods word be said.,attribution
Distractedly?,attribution
"Oh! cried the devil, what are you doing?",attribution
So the forenoon passed.,attribution
The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.,attribution
All this have we won by our labour.,attribution
What have you dreamt this time? asked he.,attribution
"At daybreak, however, everything ceased.",attribution
"Yes, certainly it is, said Jack the Dullard; and clay of the finest sort.",attribution
The cat said:,attribution
Too-whoo!,attribution
"Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.",attribution
The little cart is running.,attribution

"This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood.",attribution
Suddenly a voice cried:,attribution
Oh!,attribution
He has a birds heart that brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.,attribution
May Heaven pity us.,attribution
"Oh, said Jack the Dullard, I can hardly tell you.",attribution
HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VIST MR KORBES,attribution
How well they look!,attribution
"Well, what can the seventh and last do?",attribution
One day Frederick said.,attribution
"This time I come, then never more.",attribution
"No, Frederick, said she, that I never will.",attribution
"The third lion reminded him of Margaret, who united Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.",attribution
She is a poor girl.,attribution
"Ah, yes; sleep is a capital invention.",attribution
All this have we won by our labour.,attribution
"Good heavens, how it crushes! said the darning-needle.",attribution
What a miser she was!,attribution
How charming she was!,attribution
To thy death art thou sped Until Gods word be said.,attribution
Now came the turn of Jack the Dullard.,attribution
And then what happened?,attribution
"This time I come, then never more.",attribution
What are you saying?,attribution
I propose to you.,attribution
"No, said the Sultan; I will be true to my master.",attribution
Oh!,attribution
Olaf Hase makes halt at Ottesworde.,attribution
"The wolf greeted her, and said:",attribution
All this have we won by our labour.,attribution
Guard it well.,attribution
"Besides, who knows?",attribution
And then what happened?,attribution
The grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and snored.,attribution
Then away he went.,attribution
Perhaps he is ferrying still?,attribution
"And as he returned no answer, it said,",attribution
"Oh! cried the devil, what are you doing?",attribution
"The scullion said,",attribution
So the next morning the wolf sent the boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter.,attribution
"However, the wolf thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel.",attribution
The cat said:,attribution
"Now I will free you, Mrs. Meta Mogen!",attribution
"I am made of morocco, she said.",attribution
And now Olaf Hase arrives.,attribution
"She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:",attribution
God knows.,attribution
So the forenoon passed.,attribution
"Inferior, indeed! said the buckwheat.",attribution
"I am made of morocco, she said.",attribution
What have you dreamt this time? asked he.,attribution

"Oh, said Jack the Dullard, I can hardly tell you.",attribution
May Heaven pity us.,attribution
"Why, Gretel?",attribution
"When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly.",attribution

Can you swim?,enablement
There is something to please everybody.,enablement
May I drive with thee?,enablement
Your golden daughters come back to you.,enablement
"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,' replied Ginger.",enablement
"The body, she knew, could do no harm to any one, but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer, attach itself to him, and demand to be carried to the churchyard, that it might rest in consecrated ground.",enablement
Can you swim?,enablement
"Such things ought not to be concealed, and I will do my best to get the story into the papers, so that it becomes known throughout the land; the hens have richly deserved it, and their family too.",enablement
"There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!",enablement
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.,enablement
"Believe every word of what we tell you, said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard.",enablement
"If I kill her, what will she be good for?",enablement
"I ought to have something into the bargain, said the countryman; give a fat goose for a pig, indeed!",enablement
"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.",enablement
How are you getting on in these hard times?,enablement
"Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise.",enablement
A wooer he stands at the door out there.,enablement
Light enough for a child.,enablement
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.,enablement
"Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the birds heart, I will give it you too.",enablement
"Be kind and good to her, but remember this; from the hour we part we shall never see each other again.",enablement
"Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!",enablement
"The body, she knew, could do no harm to any one, but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer, attach itself to him, and demand to be carried to the churchyard, that it might rest in consecrated ground.",enablement
"They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--",enablement
"After some time, the linen was taken into the house, placed under the scissors, and cut and torn into pieces, and then pricked with needles.",enablement
"The thoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world.",enablement
So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--Henny's Opening Sale!,enablement
"No, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is Mrs Fox doing?",enablement
He happened to meet a nurse with a little child.,enablement
May I drive with thee?,enablement
"Certainly, young sir.",enablement
Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
"At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat.",enablement
How are you getting on in these hard times?,enablement
"Certainly, young sir.",enablement
What art is that? asked the fox.,enablement
"The body, she knew, could do no harm to any one, but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer, attach itself to him, and demand to be carried to the churchyard, that it might rest in consecrated ground.",enablement
"Bite him, Pickles! bite him! spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, he's only a German doll!",enablement
"Heaven forbid! said the ass, come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off!",enablement
"Stay here, thou wilt be of no use out there, besides thou mightest get lost!",enablement
Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?,enablement
So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--Henny's Opening Sale!,enablement
"Thank you, said the merchant's son.",enablement
"The well answered, First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.",enablement
Take a seat and rest yourselves.,enablement
Penny's penny prices!,enablement
A wooer he stands at the door out there.,enablement
"Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!",enablement
Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.,enablement
And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.,enablement
"If I were a cock, I should despise her.",enablement
Do not go in.,enablement
"Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander among the graves.",enablement
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,enablement
"I will send you into another town, to another master.",enablement
"Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.",enablement
"I ought to have something into the bargain, said the countryman; give a fat goose for a pig, indeed!",enablement
Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?,enablement
Light enough for a child.,enablement
How many arts do you understand?,enablement
Then I will not have him.,enablement
Now let us drink the health of Bertel.,enablement
"Go with it up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it.",enablement
Then I will not have him.,enablement
"And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.",enablement
I could not have done that; but I shall learn in time.,enablement
Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.,enablement
"The well answered, First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.",enablement
"With all my heart, said Hans: but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.",enablement
"I am boiling warm beer with butter, Will you be my guest for supper?",enablement
May I drive with thee?,enablement
Look what I have found on the high road.,enablement
After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.,enablement
"If I were a cock, I should despise her.",enablement
A wooer he stands at the door out there.,enablement
"There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash.",enablement
"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
"Then let him come upstairs, said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.",enablement
"With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the Princess.",enablement
"Then the huntsman said, Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.",enablement
May I drive with thee?,enablement
"No one cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to do to sew my grave clothes.",enablement
"When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it.",enablement
So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--Henny's Opening Sale!,enablement
"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?",enablement
Take a seat and rest yourselves.,enablement
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.,enablement
"Well done, sons! said the old man; you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize.",enablement
"When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.",enablement
"Well, we will try, answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.",enablement
"You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will teach you how people get away from the hounds.",enablement
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,enablement
"When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.",enablement
"So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.",enablement
"So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.",enablement
"When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, Let that alone till the morning, and heat the kings soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you dont let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.",enablement
"In milk Im breaking bread so sweet, Will you be my guest, and eat?",enablement
"The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the mans daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the womans daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking.",enablement
"With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the Princess.",enablement
In the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the fire.,enablement
What art is that? asked the fox.,enablement
"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,' replied Ginger.",enablement
Sit down and eat your supper.,enablement
Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.,enablement
"When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, Let that alone till the morning, and heat the kings soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you dont let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.",enablement
"I am boiling warm beer with butter, Will you be my guest for supper?",enablement
It is the birds heart that will bring you this good luck.,enablement
I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.,enablement
"It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one's own importance.",enablement
"What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow!",enablement
"I ought to have something into the bargain, said the countryman; give a fat goose for a pig, indeed!",enablement
"Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander among the graves.",enablement
"Well, said the butcher, I dont like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing.",enablement
How are you getting on in these hard times?,enablement
"The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would.",enablement
"The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the mans daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the womans daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking.",enablement
"Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle.",enablement
Can you swim?,enablement
"Let no man stretch forth a helping hand to her, and let friends and relations avoid her as a plague and a pestilence!",enablement
Is that all? said the fox.,enablement
May I drive with thee?,enablement
Penny's penny prices!,enablement
"You can give an answer, and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my husband.",enablement
"Then let him come upstairs, said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.",enablement
"Well, we will try, answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.",enablement

"Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.",enablement
A wooer he stands at the door out there.,enablement
Is that all? said the fox.,enablement
"Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr Fox outside.",enablement
"Believe every word of what we tell you, said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard.",enablement
"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
"Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander among the graves.",enablement
"Well, we will try, answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.",enablement
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building- the convent of Borglum.,enablement
Penny's penny prices!,enablement
"There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!",enablement
"Be kind and good to her, but remember this; from the hour we part we shall never see each other again.",enablement
"Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!",enablement
What art is that? asked the fox.,enablement
Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.,enablement
There was a rush upon the opening day.,enablement
Run over and see how that has come to pass.,enablement
"Oh, no! said the young man; sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.",enablement
Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.",enablement
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building- the convent of Borglum.,enablement
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.,enablement
"They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--",enablement

"Well, we will try, answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.",enablement

"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
"With all my heart, said the miller; but how shall I treat them?",enablement
Too-whoo! they both hooted into the neighbour's dove-cot to the doves inside.,enablement
"No, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is Mrs Fox doing?",enablement
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,enablement
Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.,enablement
"Holger Danske can appear in marble, so that people in all countries of the world may hear of the strength of Denmark.",enablement
"The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs.",enablement

And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.,enablement
"Well, we will try, answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.",enablement
"I ought to have something into the bargain, said the countryman; give a fat goose for a pig, indeed!",enablement
"No, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is Mrs Fox doing?",enablement
"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?",enablement
"The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would.",enablement
"Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.",enablement
"In milk Im breaking bread so sweet, Will you be my guest, and eat?",enablement
I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.,enablement
Pray tell me which of the flowers I shall choose for my wife.,enablement
"Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the birds heart, I will give it you too.",enablement
"Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!",enablement
"No, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is Mrs Fox doing?",enablement
"There he dismisses his warriors, presents them with their horses and harness, and gives them leave to ride home and greet his wife.",enablement
Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.,enablement
"If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.",enablement
"Poor rose-bush! said the child, let us take it with us to heaven, that it may bloom above in God's garden.",enablement
"Stay here, thou wilt be of no use out there, besides thou mightest get lost!",enablement
"The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would.",enablement
"This is the last straw, said Pickles, let us close the shop.",enablement
In the neighbour's yard.,enablement
Prenez garde aux enfants! said father owl; children should not hear such things.,enablement
Too-whoo! they both hooted into the neighbour's dove-cot to the doves inside.,enablement
"Why, said the cock, I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook dont thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!",enablement
"Well, we will try, answered he; but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.",enablement
Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?,enablement
"Well done, sons! said the old man; you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize.",enablement
Do not go in.,enablement
"Then the huntsman said, Give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.",enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
Can you swim?,enablement
How are you getting on in these hard times?,enablement
Pray tell me which of the flowers I shall choose for my wife.,enablement
"Take that to your master, said she.",enablement
"I mention no names, but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself in order to look well.",enablement
Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.,enablement
"Then let him come upstairs, said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding feast.",enablement
"And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but very snug; which is not the way to carry on a retail business.",enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
Pray tell me which of the flowers I shall choose for my wife.,enablement
What art is that? asked the fox.,enablement
There is something to please everybody.,enablement
Do not go in.,enablement
"When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it.",enablement
"Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr Fox outside.",enablement
"Said Lina: Then do you become a church, and Ill be the chandelier in it.",enablement
"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,' replied Ginger.",enablement
Then I will not have him.,enablement
"Said Lina: Then do you become a church, and Ill be the chandelier in it.",enablement
"Certainly, young sir.",enablement
What would I give to have such a prize!,enablement
And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.,enablement
Do not go in.,enablement
Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.,enablement
"Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander among the graves.",enablement
"After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried Jip!",enablement
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.,enablement
"This is the last straw, said Pickles, let us close the shop.",enablement
Pray tell me which of the flowers I shall choose for my wife.,enablement
"Let it go farther, shrieked the bats, and the hens clucked and the cocks crowed, Let it go farther!",enablement
"Why, she could tell stories, as many as you liked, on any subject.",enablement
Lie down and go to sleep; I will work for you.,enablement
"The youth, however, was without fear, and said: Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.",enablement
"Go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle.",enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
"Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly.",enablement
They came out of the back parlor.,enablement
"Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly.",enablement
"They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--",enablement
It is the birds heart that will bring you this good luck.,enablement
"Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.",enablement
"A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet.",enablement
"Just over the fowls sat the owl, with father owl and the little owls.",enablement
"Ill tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.",enablement
"A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet.",enablement
"Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.",enablement
"Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!",enablement
After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.,enablement
Light enough for a child.,enablement
"Well done, sons! said the old man; you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize.",enablement
Do you sleep or do you wake?,enablement
"The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs.",enablement
"I come from the mill, he answered, and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.",enablement
"Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!",enablement
They had plucked out all their feathers.,enablement
You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch!,enablement
"During some days in summer, the sunbeams would lie on the floor of the cellar for about half an hour.",enablement
"The next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the mans daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the womans daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking.",enablement
"It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one's own importance.",enablement
"Why, said the cock, I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook dont thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!",enablement
Is that all? said the fox.,enablement
A wooer he stands at the door out there.,enablement
"What a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow!",enablement
And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.,enablement
Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
"There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash.",enablement
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,enablement
"Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the birds heart, I will give it you too.",enablement
"Let it go farther, shrieked the bats, and the hens clucked and the cocks crowed, Let it go farther!",enablement
He happened to meet a nurse with a little child.,enablement
"Oh, no! said the young man; sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.",enablement
Too-whoo! they both hooted into the neighbour's dove-cot to the doves inside.,enablement
In the neighbour's yard.,enablement
"The well answered, First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.",enablement
Take a seat and rest yourselves.,enablement
Look what I have found on the high road.,enablement
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building- the convent of Borglum.,enablement
Can you swim?,enablement
"The thoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world.",enablement
"Go with it up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it.",enablement
"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
"Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!",enablement
With that she went to sleep.,enablement
"I can find a cure for this, thought he; now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.",enablement
"It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one's own importance.",enablement
"There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!",enablement
I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office; said Pickles.,enablement
"And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.",enablement
"Oh, no! said the young man; sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.",enablement
"Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.",enablement
"You can give an answer, and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my husband.",enablement
"If I kill her, what will she be good for?",enablement
"With the crow? why, I am going to give it to the Princess.",enablement
"Why, said the cock, I was just now saying that we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and the cook dont thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming on Sunday!",enablement
"Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.",enablement
Run over and see how that has come to pass.,enablement
"The youth, however, was without fear, and said: Just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me.",enablement
I will go out into the world and look about me.,enablement
"Such things ought not to be concealed, and I will do my best to get the story into the papers, so that it becomes known throughout the land; the hens have richly deserved it, and their family too.",enablement
At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.,enablement
"And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but very snug; which is not the way to carry on a retail business.",enablement
"Believe every word of what we tell you, said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard.",enablement
Now let us drink the health of Bertel.,enablement
And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.,enablement
"Let no man stretch forth a helping hand to her, and let friends and relations avoid her as a plague and a pestilence!",enablement
"Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr Fox outside.",enablement
"How prettily that little thing turns round! said the princess, and took the spindle and began to try and spin.",enablement
How many arts do you understand?,enablement
"If we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.",enablement
"I can find a cure for this, thought he; now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.",enablement
Sit down and eat your supper.,enablement
A wooer he stands at the door out there.,enablement
"I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning.",enablement
"Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last.",enablement
"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
"Such things ought not to be concealed, and I will do my best to get the story into the papers, so that it becomes known throughout the land; the hens have richly deserved it, and their family too.",enablement
"Why, she could tell stories, as many as you liked, on any subject.",enablement
"At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat.",enablement
"Oh, that a time might soon come for you to turn your skill to some account!",enablement
Then I will not have him.,enablement
Your golden daughters come back to you.,enablement
"Certainly, young sir.",enablement
"Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.",enablement
In the neighbour's yard.,enablement
In one of its wings (the larger one) there is still a church.,enablement
"Under the shield of the Pope, the law cannot reach thee; but Jens Glob shall reach thee!",enablement
"Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.",enablement

"I come from the mill, he answered, and wish to go to the Queen, to whom I am taking a letter; but as I have lost my way in the forest I should like to stay here over night.",enablement
"I will send you into another town, to another master.",enablement
Prenez garde aux enfants! said father owl; children should not hear such things.,enablement
"Don't talk nonsense, replied the old gentleman.",enablement
Then I will not have him.,enablement
"I can find a cure for this, thought he; now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.",enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
"If I were a cock, I should despise her.",enablement
"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.",enablement
"Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise.",enablement
"I have the same feeling about rats, replied Pickles, but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's.",enablement
"When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:",enablement
"When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, Let that alone till the morning, and heat the kings soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you dont let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.",enablement
"Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.",enablement
"The two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs.",enablement
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,enablement
With that she went to sleep.,enablement
"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
"Bite him, Pickles! bite him! spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, he's only a German doll!",enablement
Look what I have found on the high road.,enablement
Run over and see how that has come to pass.,enablement
"Well done, sons! said the old man; you have made good use of your time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not know which ought to have the prize.",enablement
"My only pleasure is to be made clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my place and have a little sensible conversation with my neighbors.",enablement
"I ought to have something into the bargain, said the countryman; give a fat goose for a pig, indeed!",enablement
"You can give an answer, and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my husband.",enablement
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building- the convent of Borglum.,enablement
"Don't talk nonsense, replied the old gentleman.",enablement
"Every one can read the newspaper for himself, but come with me to the churchyard while the sun shines and the trees are green, and let us wander among the graves.",enablement
How are you getting on in these hard times?,enablement
Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
The least they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond.,enablement
"I can find a cure for this, thought he; now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.",enablement
Sit down and eat your supper.,enablement
"Poor rose-bush! said the child, let us take it with us to heaven, that it may bloom above in God's garden.",enablement
"Well, said the butcher, I dont like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind, neighbourly thing.",enablement
I could not have done that; but I shall learn in time.,enablement
"No, thank you, miss, said the fox, what is Mrs Fox doing?",enablement
Run over and see how that has come to pass.,enablement
They came out of the back parlor.,enablement
"Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr Fox outside.",enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
Do you sleep or do you wake?,enablement
Sit down and eat your supper.,enablement
I shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them.,enablement
In fact some people wish they had gone further.,enablement
But they did not keep self- fitting sixes; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.,enablement
Do not go in.,enablement
"Then he wanted to go his way; but she took hold of him, and said, Listen, my friend, to what I am going to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds sitting on a cloak.",enablement
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].,enablement
"Wake up! wake up! crowed the cock, and flew upon his board.",enablement
On this mountain of sand is a lofty old building- the convent of Borglum.,enablement

Sit down and eat your supper.,enablement

He happened to meet a nurse with a little child.,enablement
"Let us leave him that, said the young lady; he has already lost his wealth.",enablement
With that she went to sleep.,enablement

Do you sleep or do you wake?,enablement
Pray tell me which of the flowers I shall choose for my wife.,enablement
"Take that to your master, said she.",enablement

"Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of them; but shake hands with the princess last.",enablement
It is the birds heart that will bring you this good luck.,enablement

And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.,enablement
What art is that? asked the fox.,enablement
"The well answered, First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.",enablement
"They put up the shutters, and left.",enablement
"Believe every word of what we tell you, said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard.",enablement
"Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly.",enablement
Is that all? said the fox.,enablement
In the neighbour's yard.,enablement
"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,' replied Ginger.",enablement
He happened to meet a nurse with a little child.,enablement
After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.,enablement
"It is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no doubt about it.",enablement
"Heaven forbid! said the ass, come with us Master Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have your head cut off!",enablement
"And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, Let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.",enablement
Can you swim?,enablement
Run over and see how that has come to pass.,enablement
"The well answered, First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.",enablement
"So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.",enablement
"The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me.",enablement
Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
"No one cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and I have enough to do to sew my grave clothes.",enablement
"I can find a cure for this, thought he; now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had.",enablement
How are you getting on in these hard times?,enablement

Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
"Don't talk nonsense, replied the old gentleman.",enablement
May I drive with thee?,enablement
"Let it go farther, shrieked the bats, and the hens clucked and the cocks crowed, Let it go farther!",enablement
"Go with it up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it.",enablement
There is something to please everybody.,enablement
I will go out into the world and look about me.,enablement
"Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.",enablement
"They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--",enablement
"Oh, said he, do you want to win the three groschen too?",enablement
Your dirty daughters come back to you.,enablement
"Then come with me, and be a star-gazer.",enablement
"Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs Fox.",enablement
"Let me go out today, and you look after the house by yourself.",enablement
"Your wishing-cloak hangs up in the closet, and as for the birds heart, I will give it you too.",enablement
"There is a ferry-man on the river; let him ferry you over, and you can fill your sacks on the other side.",enablement
"Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.",enablement
"Stay here, thou wilt be of no use out there, besides thou mightest get lost!",enablement
Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.,enablement
"After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips and cried Jip!",enablement
"In milk Im breaking bread so sweet, Will you be my guest, and eat?",enablement

Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.,enablement
What have you learnt?,enablement
"When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it.",enablement
"Then the sister cried out, Pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wolf, and devour me.",enablement

"And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but very snug; which is not the way to carry on a retail business.",enablement
"You can give an answer, and you have something to say for yourself, and so you shall be my husband.",enablement
"The well answered, First run to the bride, and get her to give thee some red silk.",enablement
"This is the last straw, said Pickles, let us close the shop.",enablement
Light enough for a child.,enablement
They had plucked out all their feathers.,enablement
"It is a good thing against sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one's own importance.",enablement

Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.,enablement

I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office; said Pickles.,enablement
